Tensor decomposition
====================

One of the most great features of tensors is that they can be represented compactly in decomposed form and we have powerful methods with guarantees to obtain these decomposition.

In this tutorial we will go over these decomposed forms and how to perform tensor decomposition.
Refer to [1]_ for more information on tensor decomposition.
