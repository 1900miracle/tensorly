"""Utility class and functions for the PARAFAC2 decomposition [1]_

These utility functions assume that the second mode ``(factors[1])`` evolve over
the first mode (factors[0]). Therefore, there are ``len(factors[1])`` separate 
factor matrices in the second mode. This decomposition is implemented in the same 
way as the direct fitting method described in [2] (except that the evolving mode 
and the mode that the tensor evolves over is changed). Mathematically this is 
equivalent to saying ``B[i] = P[i]@B`` for some matrix ``P[i].T@P[i] = I``, 
where ``I`` is an identity matrix.
